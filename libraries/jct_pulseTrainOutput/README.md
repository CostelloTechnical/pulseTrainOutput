Excellent. Thinking about this on a Thursday evening here in the UK, writing the README is the final, crucial step to package your library for others (and your future self!) to use. A good README tells the story of your project: what it does, why it's useful, and how to use it.

The standard format for a README is a text file named README.md. The .md stands for Markdown, which is a very simple way to add formatting like headings, lists, and code blocks to plain text.

Here is a step-by-step guide and a complete, filled-out template for your library.

Step 1: Create the File
In the root directory of your library (the jct_pulseTrainOutput/ folder), create a new text file and name it exactly README.md.

Step 2: Write the Content using Markdown
Here is a breakdown of the essential sections for a great README, complete with the actual content for your library. You can copy and paste this directly into your README.md file.

JCT Arduino Hardware Pulse Train Library
A high-performance Arduino library for generating precise discrete or continuous hardware-timed pulse trains on Uno and Mega boards.

This library allows for direct control of the AVR microcontroller's hardware timers to produce highly accurate, non-blocking square waves. It is designed to be efficient and flexible, supporting multiple concurrent pulse trains on different timer-enabled pins.

Key Features
Hardware-Timed Precision: Bypasses the standard Arduino tone() function for direct, low-level register control.

Non-Blocking Operation: Once started, the hardware generates the waveform, leaving the CPU free to perform other tasks.

Multiple Modes:

CONTINUOUS: Generate an unending square wave.

DISCRETE: Generate a precise number of pulses and then automatically stop.

Multi-Channel Support: Run multiple, independent pulse trains simultaneously on different hardware timers (up to 2 on Uno, up to 5 on Mega).

Dynamic Frequency Updates: Change the frequency of a running wave "on the fly" for effects like sirens or frequency sweeps.

Hardware Support & Pinout
This library is board-aware and will automatically use the correct timer for the pin you select.

Arduino Uno
Pin	Timer	Channel	Notes
9	Timer1	A	16-bit, high resolution.
11	Timer2	A	8-bit.

Export to Sheets
Arduino Mega 2560
Pin	Timer	Channel	Notes
11	Timer1	A	16-bit.
10	Timer2	A	8-bit.
5	Timer3	A	16-bit.
6	Timer4	A	16-bit.
46	Timer5	A	16-bit.

Export to Sheets
Note: Timer0 pins (5, 6 on Uno; 4, 13 on Mega) are intentionally unsupported to avoid conflicts with core Arduino timing functions like millis() and delay().

Installation
Click the "Code" button on this repository and select "Download ZIP".

In the Arduino IDE, go to Sketch > Include Library > Add .ZIP Library...

Select the downloaded ZIP file.

The library will now be available under Sketch > Include Library > JCT Pulse Train Output.

Basic Usage (Quick Start)
Here is a minimal example to generate a continuous 1 kHz tone on Pin 9 of an Arduino Uno.

C++

#include "jct_pulseTrainOutput.h"

// Create an object for a timer-enabled pin.
pulseTrainOutput pto(9);

void setup() {
  // Initialize the library and hardware for the chosen pin.
  pto.begin();

  // Start a continuous 1000 Hz wave.
  pto.generate(1000, CONTINUOUS);
}

void loop() {
  // The hardware generates the wave, so the loop is free!
}
API Reference
A brief overview of the main public functions.

pulseTrainOutput(uint8_t pin): Constructor. Creates a generator object for a specific pin.

begin(): Initializes the hardware and must be called in setup().

isValid(): Returns true if the pin chosen in the constructor is valid.

generate(frequency, mode, pulses): Starts a pulse train. mode can be DISCRETE or CONTINUOUS.

stop(): Immediately stops the pulse train and forces the pin LOW.

isRunning(): Returns true if the timer is currently active.

updateFrequency(newFreq): For smooth, "glitch-free" frequency changes within the current prescaler range.

updateFrequencyWithPrescalerChange(newFreq): For large, instantaneous frequency jumps that may require a prescaler change (can cause a minor timing glitch).

Examples
The library includes several examples in the examples/ directory:

continuousPulses: Demonstrates starting a continuous wave, error handling, status checking, and stopping with a millis() timer.

discretePulses: Shows how to generate a precise number of pulses.

multiToneUno: An example of running two simultaneous, independent pulse trains on an Arduino Uno.

frequencySweep: Demonstrates how to use updateFrequency() to create a smooth "siren" effect.

Performance & Limitations
Discrete Mode Frequency Limit: The maximum frequency for DISCRETE mode is limited by the CPU's ability to handle the interrupt rate. On an Arduino Uno, this limit is approximately 60 kHz for a single channel. This limit decreases as more timers are run concurrently.

Continuous Mode Frequency Limit: In CONTINUOUS mode, the hardware handles everything, allowing for much higher frequencies (up to a practical limit of 4 MHz), though signal quality degrades at very high frequencies.
